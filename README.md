# pong

This is Capt Branchflower's pong code from the L21 assignment in ECE382.

pong.h offers two functions:

- `ball_t moveBall(ball_t ballToMove)`
- `ball_t createBall(int xPos, int yPos, int xVel, int yVel, unsigned char radius)`

To use the code:

1)  Create a ball using the createBall function.
2)  Move the ball via the move ball function.
3)  Profit!

If you're unclear on how you might demo this, a sample program is included as main.c.

If you find issues, file a bug report!

Anyone is free to use this code in any way, provided they document it.
